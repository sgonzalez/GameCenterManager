GameCenterManager is a simple singleton class that has methods for authentication, leaderboard score reporting, achievement reporting, and even multiplayer! There is even a category included for making a MatchmakingViewController landscape! Note that you must link against the GameCenter framework.

Usage.m is a file showing the usage of this class, this is NOT a proper class implementation.

There is no attribution required but is greatly appreciated!

Thanks for downloading,
Santiago
